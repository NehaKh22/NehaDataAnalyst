									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>Since my childhood, creativity has been my constant companionâ€”be it dance, poetry, photography, or acting. I found joy in every artistic endeavor, but an unexpected revelation awaited me during my bachelor's degree: the allure of numbers and data.</p>									
									
									<p>Inspired by my father's enthusiasm for discovering new technologies and keeping up with the newest trends, I set off on my own quest. I started off earning a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration but quickly became interested in data analytics. This interest drove me to seek a Master's degree in Business Analytics, 
										where I could combine my business knowledge with a better grasp of data-driven decision-making.<p>
									
									<p>This choice was a turning point in my path, as I immersed myself in the complexities of data science and analytics. 
										My father's words resonated in my ears when I understood how many options were in the data-driven universe.</p>
									
									<p>My journey has been one of transformations from a world centered around creativity to the dynamic universe of data analysis.  
										This change has sharpened my capacity to combine creative and analytical talents, positioning me as a link between artistic expression and technology progress.<p>

									<p>As I continue to unravel the potential of data, my journey stands as an inspiration for those who, like me, seek to break barriers and explore the uncharted territories of knowledge. With each step forward, I aim to leave an indelible mark on the boundless canvas of technology, showcasing the transformative power of embracing diverse passions. The world of technology awaits, and I am ready to make my mark.</p>
									
									<p>If you're looking for someone to use their creative skills and work their magic on your data, you found the right person!</p>
