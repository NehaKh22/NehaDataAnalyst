									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>Since my childhood, creativity has been my constant companion—be it dance, poetry, photography, or acting. I found joy in every artistic endeavor, but an unexpected revelation awaited me during my bachelor's degree: the allure of numbers and data.</p>

									<p>I must confess, I had always shied away from numbers until I started recognizing their transformative power. Witnessing what numbers and data could achieve, especially when manipulated and played with, sparked a curiosity that I couldn't ignore. This curiosity led me to delve deeper into the world of business analytics, where I discovered the profound impact of data on decision-making.</p>
									
									<p>Growing up, I observed my dad navigating the tough terrain of business. Despite the challenges, he always encouraged me with a powerful mantra, "The world of technology is limitless. Go, learn, and see what wonders you can do with it." Inspired by his words, I completed my bachelor's in Business Administration, but my thirst for knowledge led me to a different path – a master's degree in Business Analytics.</p>
									
									<p>This decision marked a significant shift in my journey, as I immersed myself in understanding the intricacies of data science and analytics. My father's wisdom echoed in my ears as I realized the limitless possibilities that awaited in the data-driven landscape.</p>
									
									<p>My story is one of transition, from a world dominated by arts to the dynamic realm of data. The fusion of creativity and analytical prowess has become my unique perspective, positioning me as a bridge between the artistic and the technological.</p>
									
									<p>As I continue to unravel the potential of data, my journey stands as an inspiration for those who, like me, seek to break barriers and explore the uncharted territories of knowledge. With each step forward, I aim to leave an indelible mark on the boundless canvas of technology, showcasing the transformative power of embracing diverse passions. The world of technology awaits, and I am ready to make my mark.</p>
									
									<p>If you're looking for someone to use their creative skills and work their magic on your data, you found the right person!</p>
